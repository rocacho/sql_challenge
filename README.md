Module 9 Challenge

To develop the design i started using excel and then used the QDB app online to generate th Conceptual Model, Logical Model and finally the Physical modelt design that alowed me to import into Postgres and used that as a base to develop my schema which i refined using Chat GPT queries becuase i was strugguling with the uniqueness of a column within the dept_emp tables, whith this I managed to develop a composite key serving as primary key for this table

For loading the CSV files I used the Method 2: Perform PostgreSQL Import CSV Job using pgAdmin from https://hevodata.com/learn/postgresql-import-csv/#t5

After this I finally managed to pull the queries
